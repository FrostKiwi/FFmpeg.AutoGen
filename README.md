# Important Please do support Ukraine!

[GitHub response to the war in Ukraine](https://github.blog/2022-03-02-our-response-to-the-war-in-ukraine/)<br/>
GitHub as a company is also donating $100,000 to [Razom](https://razomforukraine.org/) and matching an additional $200,000 of donations from employees to help support relief efforts in the region.

**The FFmpeg API is vast and complex and this project exposes it with minimum modifications - support is very limited.
Please consider to ask *how to* questions on [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=newest&q=ffmpeg%20autogen) or in special repository on [github.com](https://github.com/Ruslan-B/FFmpeg.AutoGen.Questions/issues). 
The community may be able to offer some assistance but you will largely be on your own.
As another option you can search for a solution in C(lang) as with some effort you can convert it to C#.**

FFmpeg auto generated unsafe bindings for C#/.NET and Mono.

## Usage

The basic example of the library usage: video decoding, conversion and frame extraction to jpeg is included in ```FFmpeg.AutoGen.Example``` project.  
For the more sophisticated operations please refer to offical [ffmpeg Documentation](https://www.ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) expecially API section of it.
Nuget packages version uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and in sync with MAJOR and MINOR version of FFmpeg as PATCH incremets does not changing API.

- on Windows:  
Native ffmpeg libraries are pre bundled in this repository, please note the are GPL(!) libraries. 
The x64 libraries source from [CODEX FFMPEG](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).
Please check to example project it shows how specify path to libraries.  

- on OS X:  
Install ffmpeg via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg):
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```
Normally you need to set static ```ffmpeg.RootPath = ``` with full path to FFmpeg libraries.

- on Linux:  
Use your package manager of choice.
Normally you need to set static ```ffmpeg.RootPath = ``` with full path to FFmpeg libraries.

## Generation

The bindings generator uses [CppSharp](https://github.com/mono/CppSharp).

Prerequisites:
 - Visual Studio 2019 with C# and C++ desktop development workloads and Windows SDK for desktop.

Steps to generate:
- Run ```FFmpeg.AutoGen.CppSharpUnsafeGenerator;```
- All files with extension ```*.g.cs```  in ```FFmpeg.AutoGen``` project will be regenerated.

## Packaging ffmpeg *.dlls in a nuget package for automatic extraction
You may package the ffmpeg .dlls required to run you code in a Nuget package that you create. When a user installs your Nuget package, the ffmpeg .dlls will be automatically extracted into the directory of the binary / assembly, without the user having to paste it manually. This opens up the door for a small footprint, custom build ffmpeg library. Because the ffmpeg .dlls are not managed C# code, the packaging required manual editing of Visual Studio's `.csproj` file, after enabling your library to be build as a Nuget package. AFAIK Nuget pack on other OSs also honors these settings.
### .csproj settings
Since Visual Studio 2017, the generation of a `.nuspec` file is *not* required anymore. Put the .dlls in a subfolder (here `ffmpeg\`) in your project. In the `<ItemGroup>` tag create a `<None>` or `<Content>` tag. Specify the files to be included via the `Include` property. (Everything is case-sensitive, so `include` is invalid) set `Pack` to `true` and `PackagePath` to the target path in the nuget package. `lib\$(TargetFramework)` would place it at the same place as the binary (unless `TargetFramework` is undefined). Most crucially, specify `PackageCopyToOutput` as `true`, which performs the extraction and copying upon build.
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="FFmpeg.AutoGen.Bindings.DynamicallyLoaded" Version="5.1.1.1" />
  <None Include="ffmpeg\*.dll" Pack="true" PackagePath="lib\$(TargetFramework)" PackageCopyToOutput="true" />
</ItemGroup>
```
### Extraction not performed upon enabling PackageCopyToOutput in a Nuget package Update
Visual Studio 2022 has a bug, where extraction/copying is not performed, after enabling this packaging behaviour and pushing it as a Nuget package update, where it wasn't enabled previously. To remedy right click your project, that consumes this Nuget package, click `clean` and after that `rebuild`. Now the consuming App should extract the .dlls going forward.
